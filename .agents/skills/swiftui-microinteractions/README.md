Premium SwiftUI animation and interaction skills for AI coding agents — generate production-ready micro-interactions from plain English prompts.

Built from [legendary-Animo](https://github.com/iAmVishal16/legendary-Animo): 84 hand-crafted SwiftUI animation demos.

---

## swiftui-microinteractions

Generate premium SwiftUI animations in the legendary-Animo style — spring physics, CoreHaptics, glass morphism, and complete compilable files — from a plain English description.

```
/swiftui-microinteractions iOS toggle but the track floods with liquid when switched
/swiftui-microinteractions a notification card you can rip apart by pulling both edges
/swiftui-microinteractions edit ViscousButtonView.swift — increase tear threshold to 160pt
```

Each prompt writes a complete `.swift` file directly to your project. Supports both create and edit modes.

## Want More? Try Pro

**swiftui-microinteractions-pro** is a licensed, private superset of this skill — everything above, plus premium-exclusive patterns:

- Morphing pill ↔ circle player FABs (single-view-tree morph, never `if/else` cross-fade)
- Scratch-to-reveal Canvas masks (coupon/reward flows)
- Photos-style hero-zoom context menus
- Telegram-style chat reaction menus with animated-GIF reaction trays
- Grab-and-fling hand-integrated physics badges

```
/swiftui-microinteractions-pro a morphing music player with a pill↔circle mini-player
```

## Who This Is For

- iOS developers who want premium micro-interactions without spending days on physics tuning
- Designers prototyping gesture-driven interactions in SwiftUI
- Teams who want consistent animation quality across their app
- Anyone who wants to ship the kind of interactions that make users say "how did they do that?"

## Installation

### Option A: skills.sh CLI

```bash
npx skills add iAmVishal16/swiftui-microinteractions
```

Then use in your agent:
```
/swiftui-microinteractions iOS toggle but the track floods with liquid when switched
```

[View on skills.sh →](https://www.skills.sh/iamvishal16/swiftui-microinteractions)

### Option B: Claude Code Plugin

**Add to your `.claude/settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "swiftui-microinteractions@iamvishal16-skills": true
  },
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "iamvishal16-skills": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "iAmVishal16/swiftui-microinteractions"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Or via Claude Code CLI:**
```
/plugin marketplace add iAmVishal16/swiftui-microinteractions
/plugin install swiftui-microinteractions@iamvishal16-skills
```

### Option C: Manual Install

```bash
curl -o ~/.claude/commands/swiftui-microinteractions.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iAmVishal16/swiftui-microinteractions/main/SKILL.md
```

Skill is then available as `/swiftui-microinteractions` in any Claude Code session.

### Option D: Install With Any AI Agent

No CLI to learn: paste this into any agentic coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot agent, Codex CLI) and it installs the skill for itself.

```
Install the swiftui-microinteractions skill for yourself.

1. Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iAmVishal16/swiftui-microinteractions/main/SKILL.md
   with curl (or your shell) so the file lands byte-exact — do not retype,
   summarize, or reformat it.
2. Save it where you read your own instructions from:
     Claude Code     → ~/.claude/skills/swiftui-microinteractions/SKILL.md
     Cursor          → .cursor/rules/swiftui-microinteractions.mdc
     Windsurf        → .windsurf/rules/swiftui-microinteractions.md
     GitHub Copilot  → append to .github/copilot-instructions.md
     anything else   → append to AGENTS.md in the repo root
3. Confirm the install by printing the "swiftui-microinteractions vX.Y.Z"
   line from the file you saved.

From now on, when I describe a SwiftUI animation, follow that file's rules
precisely and write a complete, compilable .swift file.
```

Once it's installed, just describe what you want:

```
iOS toggle but the track floods with liquid when switched
```

```
a notification card you can rip apart by pulling both edges
```

```
a capsule that morphs into a red circle toggle with rubber-band physics
```

**Pin a version.** `main` always serves the newest rules; swap it for a release tag (e.g. `.../v1.24.0/SKILL.md`) when you want the install pinned to one version.

> **Why it works:** `SKILL.md` is the whole skill in one file — spring presets, haptic grammar, visual DNA, metaball recipes, code rules — and it already carries the `name` / `description` frontmatter Claude Code expects, so dropping it in place is the entire install.

---

## What's Inside

The skill encodes the full legendary-Animo aesthetic without requiring knowledge of the codebase:

- **Spring physics library** — 7 tuned presets (snap, pop, settle, morph, stiff, dial) with exact `response` + `dampingFraction` values
- **Haptic grammar** — 4-event ladder tied to interaction phases (drag start, threshold cross, commit, destroy)
- **Visual DNA** — dark background, glass morphism surfaces, 7-level opacity hierarchy, two-tone gradient system
- **Liquid metaball pattern** — `Canvas` + `.blur()` + `.contrast()` + `.blendMode(.screen)` recipe
- **Multi-phase animation chains** — stacked `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` for choreographed sequences
- **State architecture tiers** — Simple (2–4 `@State`) / Medium (5–8) / Complex (10+) with property type rules
- **Code structure law** — mandatory `MARK` layout, camelCase tokens, no magic numbers
- **Create + Edit modes** — generates new files or modifies existing ones, writes directly to disk
